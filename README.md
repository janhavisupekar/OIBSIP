Users can browse available options, select desired slots, and make reservations. The system handles conflicts, generates booking confirmations, and ensures a smooth reservation process. 

4. Guess the Number: This interactive game challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a given range. This program keeps track of user's attempts. This project showcases my understanding of control flow, random number generation, and user input handling.

5. Digital Library Management System: Developed to streamline library operations, this project enables users to add books, remove books, and track book availability.  The system highlights my knowledge of data structures, file handling, and efficient information retrieval.

These projects were completed during my internship at Oasis Infobyte, demonstrating my practical application of Java programming concepts and showcasing my ability to develop functional and user-friendly applications. They are available on my GitHub repository as examples of my internship achievements and to provide insights for other developers and aspiring interns..
